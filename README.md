Under Night Title Editor by Zander3312

NOTICE: There is no guarantee you won't be banned for using a custom title. There have been no bans so far from use in UNICLR over the past 2 years, but the possibility is still nonzero. Use at your own risk and don't say I didn't warn you.

To use, place in the same directory as a UNICLR or Uni 2 save file and run.
You can find your save by going to Steam and right clicking the game's name and going to Manage > Browse local files.
From there, go to Save > {your Steam ID}. SYS-DATA is your save.
Program will output a file called "SYS-DATAoutput". It makes a new file for a reason; make sure it works before deleting your old save!
Rename it to SYS-DATA and replace it in the previously mentioned file path and you'll be done.
Maximum title length is 63 characters. Try to stick to characters you could find on a normal English keyboard.
If you find any bugs let me know. Have fun.
